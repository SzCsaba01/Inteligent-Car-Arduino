# Inteligent-Car-Arduino

In this project I used Arduino to make a smart car. With a phone you can connect via bluetooth to the car and control it with an app called: Bluetooth RC Controller. It can go forward, backward, left, right with the car. A WCMCU-2812B-12 with 12 RGB LEDs shows which way you're going. You cannot move forward if there is any obstacle in front less than 20cm and the LEDs show red color
